How to fix fatal: origin does not appear to be a git repository
The fatal: ‘origin’ does not appear to be a git repository error occurs when you try to commit to a newly made git repository created using the git init command. This happens because git init does not link a local repository to a remote repository. You can check this by running:

git remote -v
If there is no remote repo called origin, you should try the following solution.


To fix the error :- 

Inform Git of the location of the remote repository by running the following command:

git remote add origin <remote_URL>
where remote_URL is the link to the repository where you want your code to be stored.

Push your code by running the following command:

git push origin master
